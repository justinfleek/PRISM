# Theme preview images for README

These images are captured from [gallery.html](../../gallery.html) for the main README.

**Generate them** (from repo root):

```bash
npm install puppeteer
node scripts/generate_readme_previews.js
```

Then commit the generated `.png` files so the README displays the previews on GitHub.
